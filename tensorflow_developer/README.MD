### FAQ
~~~
When will I find out how I did on my exam?
Exams can take up to two weeks to grade, depending on volume. Once grading has been finalized, you will receive an email telling you whether you passed (and will receive a certificate), or when you can retake the exam. Note that to protect the integrity of the exam, we do not communicate candidate scores or where candidates did well or poorly within an exam.
How many attempts do I have to pass the exam?
Candidates have one attempt per exam purchase.
What happens if I fail?
If you don't pass on your first attempt, you must wait 14 days before purchasing and taking the exam again.
If you don't pass on your second attempt, you can purchase and retake the exam after a two month waiting period.
If after three attempts you still have not passed the exam, you must wait one year.
